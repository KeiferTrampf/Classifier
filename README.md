## TEXT CLASSIFIER

I'm working on this light weight text-classifier I was hoping to use in my midterm project, but crunch time came a little sooner than I had expected. Either way, to see how well my first trained AI system works out. This is also a good experiment to use an extension called continue to run local chat assistants with the same core functionality as the co-pilot that is pre-installed on VS Code.

### CONCEPT

Ideally, any user should be able to just post anything, and then the system should assign a value that respresents a catagory. then, the user should be able to click on any of the buttons on the nav bar and see all the posts that had been classified under a given label.
